# 💻 LeetLab

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to **LeetLab**, my little corner of the coding universe.  

Here, I share **daily LeetCode solutions in Python**, with **step-by-step explanations and handy tips**. The goal is simple: **learn, grow, and have fun while solving problems**! Occasionally, I try problems in C++ or C for extra practice, but Python is my main language.

## 🗂 How This Repo is Organized


- **Folders by topic** → Arrays, Strings, Recursion, DP  
- **Solution files** → Each problem is a separate Python file with comments explaining logic and edge cases  
- **Folder README.md** → Summarizes patterns learned, tips, and notes for that topic

## 🚀 How I Solve Problems

1. **Understand the Problem** – carefully read the question, inputs, outputs, and constraints  
2. **Plan an Approach** – decide which data structures or algorithms to use  
3. **Outline Steps in Comments** – write pseudo-code or step-by-step plan before coding  
4. **Write Clean Python Code** – keep it readable and well-commented  
5. **Test Edge Cases** – ensure the solution works for all inputs  
6. **Reflect & Optimize** – consider time/space improvements and reusable patterns

## 📌 Tips for Fellow Coders

- Solve problems **daily** to build consistency  
- Focus on **patterns**, not just individual problems  
- Comment your code — shows your thought process and professionalism  
- Track patterns in **folder README.md files**  
- Use **descriptive commit messages** → shows workflow and commitment
